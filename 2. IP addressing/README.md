# IP addressing

In this project we learned about IP planning and IP addressing. This directory contains 2 projects:

- hosts with multiple network IDs IP addressing
- Hosts with unique network IDs IP addressing

you can test connections with pinging hosts or using tracert command in hosts. And you can check IP addresses using packet tracer GUI or with ipconfig command.
