# RIPv2 routing

In this project we implemented routing using RIP version 2.
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a dynamic routing protocol that uses hop count as a routing metric to find the best path between the source and the destination network. It is a distance-vector routing protocol that has an AD value of 120 and works on the Network layer of the OSI model. RIP uses port number 520. RIP v2 is known as Classless Routing Protocol because it sends information of subnet mask in its routing update.

use specified commands for checking and debugging routing algorithm.

you can test connections with pinging hosts or using tracert command in hosts.
