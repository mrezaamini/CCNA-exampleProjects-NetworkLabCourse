# EIGRP & OSPF routing

In this project we used EIGRP & OSPF algorithm for routing. first we make a topology file that contains our basic configurations and ip addresses. After that, based on our topology we used OSPF and EIGRP as our routing algorithm. So this directory contains 3 files:

- topology network
- network routing using OSPF
- network routing using EIGRP

you can test connections with pinging hosts or using tracert command in hosts and use specified commands for debugging and checking routing tables.
