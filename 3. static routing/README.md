# Static routing

In this project we want to start configuring routing and we start with static routing (command : ip route). First we set static routing in designed network and then in the next step we remove router3 from routes to other networks. So this directory contains 2 projects:

- static routing in our network
- removing router3 from routes

you can test connections with pinging hosts or using tracert command in hosts.
