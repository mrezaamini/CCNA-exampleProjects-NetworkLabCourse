# Static routing

In this project we want to start configuring routing and we start with static routing (command : ip route). First we set static routing in designed network and then in the next step we remove router3 from routes to other networks. So this directory contains 2 projects:

- static routing in our network
- removing router3 from routes

Static Routing is also known as non-adaptive routing which doesnâ€™t change the routing table unless the network administrator changes or modifies them manually. Static routing does not use complex routing algorithms and It provides high or more security than dynamic routing.

you can test connections with pinging hosts or using tracert command in hosts.
