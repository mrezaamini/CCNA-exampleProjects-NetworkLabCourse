# Wireless LAN

In this project we tried to implement different scenarios and projects that is possible in a wireless LAN:

- Wireless LAN with a router
- Wireless LAN with a router that has authentication
- Wireless LAN with an access point that has authentication
- MAC address filtering in a wireless LAN

you can test connections with pinging hosts or using tracert command in hosts. Or access to wireless GUI with the IP address of router/access point (192.168.1.1) as the url in one of the host's browsers. (user: admin / password: admin)
